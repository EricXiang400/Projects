# Project 3 Prep

**For tessellating hexagons, one of the hardest parts is figuring out where to place each hexagon/how to easily place hexagons on screen in an algorithmic way.
After looking at your own implementation, consider the implementation provided near the end of the lab.
How did your implementation differ from the given one? What lessons can be learned from it?**

Answer: My implementation is different in a way that I did not use 
any other extrea class to seperate the work load. I learned
that I should use extrea class to help seperate the task.

**Can you think of an analogy between the process of tessellating hexagons and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways?
What is the hexagon and what is the tesselation on the Project 3 side?**

Answer: I think one analogy that I can see between the process of tessellating hexagons 
and randomly generating a world using rooms and hallways is that a room is always next to a hallway
and a hallway is what leads up to a room. 

-----
**If you were to start working on world generation, what kind of method would you think of writing first? 
Think back to the lab and the process used to eventually get to tessellating hexagons.**

Answer: I think I would write a position class so that I can keep track of the positins of the walls.

-----
**What distinguishes a hallway from a room? How are they similar?**

Answer: A hallway is different from a room in a way that a room
is enclosed by walls, a hallway is a path that lead to a room.
